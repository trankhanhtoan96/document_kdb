A kdb+ system contains the following two components:

- KDB+ − the database (k database plus)

- Q − the programming language for working with kdb+

Both `kdb+` and `q` are written in k programming language (same as `q` but less readable).

# Why use KDB+
a single solution for real-time data with analytics. Kdb+ stores database as ordinary native files, so it does not have any special needs regarding hardware and storage architecture. It is worth pointing out that the database is just a set of files, so your administrative work won’t be difficult.

# Where
As the volume of data is increasing day by day, we need a system that can handle huge volumes of data. KDB+ fulfills this requirement. KDB+ not only stores an enormous amount of data but also analyzes it in real time.
